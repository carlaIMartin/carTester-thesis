### What does the app do?
  The CarDoctor application is designed to offer a range of features to facilitate vehicle 
diagnostics and maintenance. Key functionalities include the ability to perform 
comprehensive diagnostic scans on vehicles, allowing users to identify issues without the 
need for specialized tools or professional assistance and also find a solution to them by 
using scraping algorithms. The application provides detailed information on each 
diagnostic code, including the ID, name, category, description, response code, and order 
number. To give a more in-depth experience to the users, the application offers 
suggestions for parts that may need replacement based on diagnostic results and provides 
general maintenance advice to help users keep their vehicles in good condition. Additional 
features include visualization of vehicle performance data and diagnostic history, the 
ability to save and view snapshots of diagnostic data over time, and a search functionality 
to filter diagnostic codes and parts by name or other criteria.
